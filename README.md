TensorBank is a collection of assorted algorithms expressed in Tensors.

We do not intend to limit ourselves to a specific domain.  The initial batch of
algorithms is focused on point and box gemoetry for some object detection
tasks, but more algorithms will be added later.

We are open to all backends, including Tensorflow, Pytorch, and NumPy.
